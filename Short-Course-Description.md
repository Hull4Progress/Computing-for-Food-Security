# Computing for Food Security - Short Course Description

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was founded
in 1945 with the goals of eradicating world hunger and enabling food
security for all people.  A key focus of the FAO, and several other
organizations, is to enable a deep understanding of food production
and consumption by gathering, analyzing and disseminating relevant
data both past and present.  Today, there is a plethora of data
available about agricultural productivity, consumption, trade and
nutritional characteristics; soil types and quality; anticipated
population growth; and the potential impacts of climate change – all
with a global scope and much of it with fine granularity.

This course provides a broad introduction to the area of food
(in)security and the impacts of climate change, with an emphasis on
computational tools and techniques for understanding, visualizing and
predicting current and future agricultural production.  This course
provides a broad introduction to the area of food (in)security with an
emphasis on: computational tools and techniques for understanding,
visualizing and predicting current and future agricultural production,
trade and needs; the interplay of agriculture, greenhouse gases and
climate change; optimizing for simultaneous maximization of food
production, carbon sequestration, and bio-diversity; and tools to
support Climate Smart Agriculture.

This course is intended for Computer Science students who have an interest
in agriculture and/or the UN Sustainability Goals around ending Food Insecurity.
It is hoped that the course will give students a broad understanding
of the area, and if they want to go deeper, to give them an initial basis for
joining a team of Agroscientists, Public Policy specialists and other Computer Scientists to
work on issues of crop prediction, longer term agricultural planning in the face of
climate change, and national or federal level food security issues.

Prerequisites: Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or similar
field, including substantial programming experience and at least some
experience with relational database management.  The course will be
taught using a variety of Python-based tools, Postgres, and several
application packages (including Protégé, Tableau, and APSIM), although
students are welcome to code their assignments with other languages
and packages if they choose.
