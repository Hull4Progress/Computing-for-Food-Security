# Computing for Food Security -- Course Overview


The course is organized into 4 main sections:
1. Food production and consumption, world-wide
1. Predicting agricultural productivity: Micro and Macro
1. Agriculture and Climate Change
1. Optimizations for Productivity and Sustainability

The course will be presented during the 10-week Spring quarter of 2023.
There will be one 2-hour lecture each week, on Wednesday.
Each of the main sections will be covered in 2 to 3 weeks.

## Food production and consumption, world-wide

### Course Overview:

- Socio-economic perspectives; Food (In)security
  - e.g., UN Sustainable Goals; mission of FAO
  - e.g., draw from [FAO The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2022](https://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/2022/en/)
  - Food systems overview (e.g., [visible and invixible flows of ag prod](https://www.iisd.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/mueller-2015-food-system-type-figure.jpg)
- FAO (and related) data sets; data and tools, including production, trade,
  - Illustrative example: Impact of war in Ukraine on food supply
- Crop yield prediction; tools
- Interplay of agriculture and climate change
- Trade-offs between productivity and environmental impact

### Intro to FOA and related data on production, trade, nutrition, nutritional needs

- [FAO Ag production statistics (1961-2020)](https://www.fao.org/food-agriculture-statistics/data-release/data-release-detail/en/c/1491961/)
- [FAO Trade of ag commodities (1986-2020)](https://www.fao.org/food-agriculture-statistics/data-release/data-release-detail/en/c/1507740/)
- [FAO Central Product Classification (CPC) v2.1](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/unsdclassifications/cpcv21.pdf) and also see
  [dataset available here](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/cpc)
- Some data set about nutrition in foods -- ??
  - Draw from pp. 19 and following from "Global Food Security" by Zhang-Yue Zhou (2020)
  - Shift in perspectives about nutrition, from calories alone to nutritious diet overall
    (cf [2020 SOFI report](https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cc0639en)
- Some data set about country-level populations and nutritional needs -- ??

### Key themes

- Talk about challenges of gathering global-level data, and  standardizing across data sets
  - e.g., challenge of harmonizing production and trade data sets
  - e.g., [FAO Zambia training deck](https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/ess/CountrySTAT/Zambia_training_2012/Classification_Correspondence_Table.pdf)
- Talk about role of Computer Scientists in the larger ecosystem of achieving social goals
 
### Computing illustrations and exercise

- Bringing data into Postgres, including "normalization", using Python, Jupyter, DBeaver (students may use their favorite tools)
  - Talk about challenges of creating diverse datasets that can be used together
- Use of Protege ontology tool to help visualize categories
- Visualization using Tableau Public and/or DataWrapper
  - Importance of pre-processing data for use with these visualization tools

- Student exercise (over first 2 or 3 weeks) is to download and organize the data,
  ask an interesting question (e.g., given reduction of Ukraine's ag output due to
  the war, what is impact on food levels available to Ghana as compared with 2019
  levels?) and produce some informative visualizations the communicate the answer
