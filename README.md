# Computing for Food Security

This repository holds materials for a graduate-level Computer Science
course on computing technologies relevant to modern agriculture, the
interplay of agriculture and climate change, and the goal of ending
food insecurity worldwide.  The initial offering of the course
will be at the University of California, Davis, during the Spring
quarter, 2023.  

This repository is currently "under development", and will be updated
repeatedly in coming months.

We are very interested in comments and feedback.  Please submit comments
as new "Issues".

A (draft) course overview, including major topics to be covered,
source materials, and programming exercises may be found
