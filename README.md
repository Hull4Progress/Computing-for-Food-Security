# Computing for Food Security

This repository holds materials for a graduate-level Computer Science
course on computing technologies relevant to modern agriculture, the
interplay of agriculture and climate change, and the goal of ending
food insecurity worldwide.  The initial offering of the course
was offered at the University of California, Davis, during the Spring
quarter, 2023.  

This repository gives an overview of the materials used by the course.
This follows the course presented at UC Davis, but has been updated to
reflect some lessons learned and additional content.

We are very interested in comments and feedback!  Please submit comments
