# Computing for Food Security - Short Course Description

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was founded
in 1945 with the goals of eradicating world hunger and enabling food
security for all people.  A key focus of the FAO, and several other
organizations, is to enable a deep understanding of food production
and consumption by gathering, analyzing and disseminating relevant
data from the past and present, and making predictions into the
future.  This course provides a broad introduction to the area of food
(in)security with an emphasis on: computational tools and techniques
for understanding, visualizing and predicting current and future
agricultural production, trade and needs; the interplay of
agriculture, greenhouse gases and climate change; optimizing for
simultaneous maximization of food production, carbon sequestration,
and bio-diversity; and tools to support Climate Smart Agriculture.
